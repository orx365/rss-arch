> Disclaimer : *Journalism plays a vital role in the healthy functioning of our society. This thought came to me during a time when I couldn't afford access to the media I relied on. I also have concerns about getting information from social media, since I believe there is a conflict of interest between the social media platform and the information provider. Please use this tool responsibly.*

It may however be simpler if you just [`clone this repo`](./colophon) and choose you own RSS feeds. A simple description of this project is available at [**colophon**](./colophon). It is propably the best and most efficent way for you to go forward. *Have fun*...
